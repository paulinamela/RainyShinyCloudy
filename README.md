# RainyShinyCloudy
The weather app written in Swift 3 for iOS devices, using REST services, Alamofire and geolocalization.
The app has been developed during one of the Udemy courses and upgraded later on (for instance, the kelvin to celsius formula has been added
instead of the kelvin-fahrenheit conversion). The app is supposed to check and display the current weather forecast for current user location, but
also it provides the forecast for the next few days based on the data from OpenWeather API.
